<p>
Brian had some heavy health issues, causing him to give up his dream to
be a major league baseball player. Instead, he used his recovery time to
learn the ropes of the DJ & producer scene. It was music that kept him going,
as he locked himself up in his basement for hours and hours, mastering the art
he now fully owns. Fast forward to 5 years later and we find TLUXX sharing the
stage with the likes of Headhunterz, Zomboy, CandyLand, MAKO and Party Favor.

His drive has brought him a successful win at New Mexico’s Sun City Music
Festival DJ Contest, a residency in Albuquerque’s Lotus and Gravity clubs
and gigs all across the state. His annual Play It Forward charity event
raises an average $2000 for the local homeless teen shelter, a cause he
continues to support. Eager to conquer more stages, rock the world’s festivals
and see clubs all around the globe, TLUXX doesn’t let his nickname
‘The Kid’ play down his passion.

Going against the tide, the youngster doesn’t follow any trend, but relies on
his own instinct and producing what feels right. Whether that be the sturdy
sound of progressive house or any other electronic dance music genre, as long
as it’s got the right energy and flow, it ends up in his sets.

<p>
With a master plan in mind and the right mix of talent and determination,
TLUXX might just be the next big thing you’ll hear about. And yes, you might
want to listen up.

Project Bugs
The issue that I had on my project was the subscribe page.  In order to write the users input to a csv file, I had to download a local server software and other things that I did not understand.  Therefore,  it was a bit much for me to understand at this point. The form acts the way I want it to, but does not write to a cvs file. 

Possible Improvement:
1. better music player
2. get rid of weather script 
3. Add additional tabs, such as a possible shop,  music videos, photo gallary. 
4. Make sure from works

Original Final Project Plan.

For my final project, I would like to create single artist page that will help people learn a bit more about my music and myself. (TLUXX)

Users: My audience would be people who enjoy Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and attend music festivals.

I started this in the html exercise we had in week 6.

The site will include Buttons for; A bio, upcoming shows, articles, and a music shop.

Each button will take the user to an area where they can get information about the artist.

The main part of the page will be giving people access to all the music I have released. This part will be the Javascript portion of the site. Kind of like the Album store we created in week 6. Maybe allow people to make comment and rate songs.

It would be nice to have an area where people can subscribe to my page with their email address, so I would be able to notify them of upcoming shows and releases.
